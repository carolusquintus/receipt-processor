# Receipt Processor Challenge
#### by [carolusquintus](https://github.com/carolusquintus)

This is `receipt-proccess` challenge developed by Carlos Rosas for Fetch Backend Engginer position.

## Setup local environment

The only assume is that the reviewer has UNIX like OS workstation and Docker.

Open your Terminal and follow next steps.

1. Download SDKMan:
```
$ curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
```
![SDKMan install](screenshots/14-ago-2023_21-49-13.png)

2. Install java jdk 17:
```
$ sdk install java 17.0.8-zulu
```
![jdk install](screenshots/14-ago-2023_21-51-27.png)

3. Install Gradle
```
$ sdk install gradle 7.6.1
```
![jdk install](screenshots/14-ago-2023_21-52-44.png)

Previous steps are not strictly necessary, because this project uses gradle wrapper.

But there's no reason to take risks :smiley:
